\usage{
residuals_phregr(
  fit_phregr,
  type = c("martingale", "deviance", "score", "schoenfeld", "dfbeta", "dfbetas",
    "scaledsch"),
  collapse = FALSE,
  weighted = (type \%in\% c("dfbeta", "dfbetas"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_phregr}{The output from the \code{phregr} call.}

\item{type}{The type of residuals desired, with options including
\code{"martingale"}, \code{"deviance"}, \code{"score"},
\code{"schoenfeld"}, \code{"dfbeta"}, \code{"dfbetas"}, and
\code{"scaledsch"}.}

\item{collapse}{Whether to collapse the residuals by \code{id}.
This is not applicable for Schoenfeld type residuals.}

\item{weighted}{Whether to compute weighted residuals.}
}
\value{
For martingale and deviance residuals, the result is a vector
with one element corresponding to each subject (without \code{collapse}).
For score residuals, the result is a matrix where each row represents
a subject and each column corresponds to a variable. The row order
aligns with the input data used in the original fit. For Schoenfeld
residuals, the result is a matrix with one row for each event and
one column per variable. These rows are sorted by time within strata,
with the attributes \code{stratum} and \code{time} included.

Score residuals represent each individual's contribution to the score
vector. Two commonly used transformations of this are \code{dfbeta},
which represents the approximate change in the coefficient vector
if the observation is excluded, and \code{dfbetas}, which gives the
approximate change in the coefficients scaled by the standard error
of the coefficients.

\description{
Obtains the martingale, deviance, score, or Schoenfeld
residuals for a proportional hazards regression model.
}
\details{
For score and Schoenfeld type residuals, the proportional hazards model
must include at least one covariate. The algorithms for \code{deviance},
\code{dfbeta}, \code{dfbetas}, and \code{scaledsch} residuals follow
the \code{residuals.coxph} function in the \code{survival} package.
