\arguments{
\item{data}{The input data frame that contains the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{rep}: The replication for by-group processing.

\item \code{event}: The event indicator.
}}

\item{rep}{The name of the replication variable in the input data.}

\item{stratum}{The name of the stratum variable in the input data.}

\item{treat}{The name of the treatment variable in the input data.}

\item{time}{The name of the time variable in the input data.}

\item{event}{The name of the event variable in the input data.}

\item{milestone}{The milestone time at which to calculate the
restricted mean survival time.}

\item{rmstDiffH0}{The difference in restricted mean survival times
under the null hypothesis. Defaults to 0 for superiority test.}

\item{conflev}{The level of the two-sided confidence interval for
the difference in restricted mean survival times. Defaults to 0.95.}

variance estimate of individual restricted mean survival times.
Defaults to no bias correction.}
}
\value{
