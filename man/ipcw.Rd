\description{
Uses the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW)
method to obtain the hazard ratio estimate of the Cox model to
adjust for treatment switching.
}
\details{
We use the following steps to obtain the hazard ratio estimate
and confidence interval had there been no treatment switching:
\itemize{
\item Exclude observations after treatment switch.
\item Set up the crossover and event indicators for the last time interval
for each subject.
\item For time-dependent covariates Cox switching models, replicate unique
event times across treatment arms within each subject.
\item Fit the denominator switching model (and the numerator switching model
for stabilized weights) to obtain the inverse probability
of censoring weights. This can be a Cox model with time-dependent
covariates or a pooled logistic regression model. For pooled logistic
regression switching model, the probability of remaining uncensored
(i.e., not switching) will be calculated by subtracting the
predicted probability of switching from 1 and then multiplied over
time up to the current time point.
\item Fit the weighted Cox model to the censored outcome survival times
to obtain the hazard ratio estimate.
\item Use either robust sandwich variance or bootstrapping to construct the
p-value and confidence interval for the hazard ratio.
If bootstrapping is used, the confidence interval
and corresponding p-value are calculated based on a t-distribution with
\code{n_boot - 1} degrees of freedom.
