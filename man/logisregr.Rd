\details{
Fitting a logistic regression model using Firth's bias reduction method
is equivalent to penalization of the log-likelihood by the Jeffreys prior.
Firth's penalized log-likelihood is given by
\deqn{l(\beta) + \frac{1}{2} \log(\mbox{det}(I(\beta)))}
and the components of the gradient \eqn{g(\beta)} are computed as
\deqn{g(\beta_j) + \frac{1}{2} \mbox{trace}\left(I(\beta)^{-1}
\frac{\partial I(\beta)}{\partial \beta_j}\right)}
The Hessian matrix is not modified by this penalty.

Firth's method reduces bias in maximum likelihood estimates of
coefficients, but it introduces a bias toward one-half in the
predicted probabilities.

A straightforward modification to Firth’s logistic regression to
achieve unbiased average predicted probabilities involves a post hoc
adjustment of the intercept. This approach, known as Firth’s logistic
regression with intercept correction (FLIC), preserves the
bias-corrected effect estimates. By excluding the intercept from
penalization, it ensures that we don't sacrifice the accuracy of
effect estimates to improve the predictions.
